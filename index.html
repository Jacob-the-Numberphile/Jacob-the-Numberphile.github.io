    <p class="intro"> 
        I am a future data scientist with a background in mathematics and statistics. I am currently a senior at the University of San Jose State. 
        Throughout my journey as a data scientist, I have parricipated in many fascninating projects and worked many 
        interesting jobs. These projects include The CAMCOS Project, the Center for Applied Mathematics and Computational Statistics at San Jose State University
        providing valuable insight to Ethereum on their use of blockchain technology. Also, I have used my skills as a statistician
        to help the San Jose State University Center for Applied Mathematics and Computational Statistics develop a new model for predicting the behavior of the framework 
        under which the Ethereum blockchain is currently running. Furthermore, I have experiance working as a math tutor for Evergreen Valley College
        and as a homework grader for San Jose State University.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p class="education">
        I am currently a senior at the University of San Jose State. I am pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from San Jose State University.
        I have taken nearly all of my probability and statistics courses and have applied them in many interesting data science projects.
        I have a 3.7 GPA and have been inducted into the Phi Kappa Phi Honors Society for being in the top 5% of juniors in that semester. 
        I have a AS-T from Evergreen Valley College in Mathematics and a high school diploma from Ocean Grove Charter School.

    <h2>Work Experience and Research Projects</h2>
    <h3>CAMCOS Project</h3>
    <p class="camcos">
        I spent a semester working in CAMCOS, an intensive applied mathematics project contracted by Ethereum. The project involved a new pricing mechanism
         called EIP-1559, which was introduced into the marketplace to solve block congestion and bring transactions on the blockchain. My involvement with 
         the project was acquiring a node to obtain data, cleaning the data, and using various graphs and statistical techniques to visualize and analyze the data. 
         Furthermore, I had to learn a lot about how the Ethereum marketplace works, along with the various terms, jargon, and specific economic behaviors that are 
         associated with a cryptocurrency-based economy. I tested the effectiveness of EIP-1559 by running simulations of the different pricing mechanisms to determine 
         if the intended effect was reached.

    <h3>Homework Grader</h3>
    <p class="hw_grader">
        I have experience as a Homework grader for an upper-division vector calculus course from August 2020 to December 2020. My duties involved facilitating breakout
         rooms in class at the professor’s discretion and grading homework and exams pursuant to the professor’s rubric. I also assisted in proctoring and grading final exams.
    </p>

    <h3>Math Tutor</h3>
    <p class="math_tutor">
        1 semester of experience working as a math tutor for Evergreen Valley College for 5 months (January 2019-May2019). I learned both leadership skills, public speaking, 
        and how to communicate with a wide variety of students while teaching math at Evergreen Valley College. I would teach students in group settings, one on one settings,
         as well as a drop-in and drop-out setting. I taught students on a variety of courses, from elementary algebra to upper-division linear algebra. Twice a week I would also
          provide in-class assistance for a mathematics professor, I would assist the professor with day-to-day tasks as well as provide help to students both in and out of the classroom.
