    <h2 class="about_me">About Me</h2>




    
    <p class="intro"> 
        I am a future data scientist with a background in mathematics and statistics. I am currently a senior at the University of San Jose State. 
        Throughout my journey as a data scientist, I have parricipated in many fascninating projects and worked many 
        interesting jobs. These projects include The CAMCOS Project, the Center for Applied Mathematics and Computational Statistics at San Jose State University
        providing valuable insight to Ethereum on their use of blockchain technology. Also, I have used my skills as a statistician
        to help the San Jose State University Center for Applied Mathematics and Computational Statistics develop a new model for predicting the behavior of the framework 
        under which the Ethereum blockchain is currently running. Furthermore, I have experiance working as a math tutor for Evergreen Valley College
        and as a homework grader for San Jose State University.
    </p>


    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
    <p class="my_education">
        I am currently a senior at the University of San Jose State. I am pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from San Jose State University.
        I have taken nearly all of my probability and statistics courses and have applied them in many interesting data science projects.
        I have a 3.7 GPA and have been inducted into the Phi Kappa Phi Honors Society for being in the top 5% of juniors in that semester. 
        I have a AS-T from Evergreen Valley College in Mathematics and a high school diploma from Ocean Grove Charter School.

    <h3>CAMCOS Project</h3>
    <p class="camcos">
        I spent a semester working in CAMCOS, an intensive applied mathematics project contracted by Ethereum. The project involved a new pricing mechanism
         called EIP-1559, which was introduced into the marketplace to solve block congestion and bring transactions on the blockchain. My involvement with 
         the project was acquiring a node to obtain data, cleaning the data, and using various graphs and statistical techniques to visualize and analyze the data. 
         Furthermore, I had to learn a lot about how the Ethereum marketplace works, along with the various terms, jargon, and specific economic behaviors that are 
         associated with a cryptocurrency-based economy. I tested the effectiveness of EIP-1559 by running simulations of the different pricing mechanisms to determine 
         if the intended effect was reached. Furthermore, I analyzed the fluctuation of the gas and gas prices of the transaction fee marketplace to determine the overall 
         effectiveness of the EIP-1559 pricing mechanism. The heart of the CAMCOS project was modeling internal user valuations, a metric that intrinsically models how much a user 
         wants their transaction included into the blockchain. Throughout my time at CAMCOS, I utilized hypothesis and distribution testing between the valuations of the different 
         pricing regimes and used MLE to generate appropriate parameters for each pricing regime; then, by collaborating with the theory team, we were able to generate a optimal bidding funtion
            for the EIP-1559 pricing mechanism. Furthermore, I used the Python programming language and an associated shared repository (Github) to priovide visualizations of the
             various aspects of EIP-1559, from miner revenue vs transaction fees, block size oscilations over time, gas user per block over time, and the valuations of the different pricing regimes.
             The project culminated in an oral presentation of our team's findings to Ethereum.

    <h3>Student Research Projects</h3>
    <p class="academic_research">
        In my time at San Jose State University I have had the pleasure of working on larger group projects that utilize programming, data analysis, and statistical techniques.
       These projects are:
    </p>

    <h4>Historical Milton Friedman Data Analysis Project</h4>   
    <p class="milton_friedman">
        One of my favorite projects at San Jose State University is the Historical Milton Friedman Data Analysis Project. This project was a group project that involved myself working with a group of 
        individuals in the second semester Applied Statistics course at San Jose State University. While this was a group project, the data cleaning and analysis was done by myself. The project consisted of aquiring the dataset
        and subsetting the observations to the most current year to get the most consistent amount of non-empty values. Afterwards, the entries that still had empty values in their remaining features had their aggregated values
        used as a substitute. Afterwards, the deleniation between developed and developing countries was included into the dataset for 2006 (as that feature had originally been ommited), which lead to a fascninating discovery. After appropraite
        outlier removal and statistical testing, a very strong multifactor linear correlation was found between the average number of procedures to start a buisness and GDP per capita between developed and developing countries. Essentially, 
        the more procedures to start a buisness, the less GDP per capita the country had.

    <h4>Covid 19 Data Analysis Project</h4>
    <p class="covid_19">
        Another project that I worked on at San Jose State University was the Covid 19 Data Analysis Project. This project was much more of a collaborative effort thatn the Milton Friedman Data Analysis Project; however, my role in this project 
        was still very involved and rewarding. In this semester project, our goal ws to acquire, analzse, and visualize the data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the state of California over various counties over time. Also, my visualizations deliniated between 
        the pre and post vaccine periods, which yielded interesting results. After one of the group members cleaned the data, my goal was to visualize the relationship betweeen hospitolizations and unemployment rates in the early months of the Covid Pandemic 
        in various ways. First, illustrated the relationship with a scatterplot, which revealed that for the pre-vaccine period, the hospitalizations tend to stay below 10,000 and have a high variability in terms of emplyment. In contranst, the post vaccine 
        unemplyment rated universally stay at 10-12%, while experiancing a high variability in terms of hospitalizations. Furthermore, I analyzed the two features over time, which revealed an initial spike in unemployment which gradually reduces to a normal 
        period over time, and hospitalizations gradually increasing until a sudden and pronounced spike in the October to to February time period.

    <h3>Homework Grader</h3>
    <p class="hw_grader">
        I have experience as a Homework grader for an upper-division vector calculus course from August 2020 to December 2020. My duties involved facilitating breakout
         rooms in class at the professor's discretion and grading homework and exams pursuant to the professorâ€™s rubric. I also assisted in proctoring and grading final exams.
    </p>

    <h3>Math Tutor</h3>
    <p class="math_tutor">
        one semester of experience working as a math tutor for Evergreen Valley College for five months (January 2019-May 2019). I learned both leadership skills, public speaking, 
        and how to communicate with a wide variety of students while teaching math at Evergreen Valley College. I would teach students in group settings, one on one settings,
         as well as a drop-in and drop-out setting. I taught students on a variety of courses, from elementary algebra to upper-division linear algebra. Twice a week I would also
          provide in-class assistance for a mathematics professor. I would assist the professor with day-to-day tasks as well as provide help to students both in and out of the classroom.
